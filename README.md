Submitted by: **Trinity Morgan**

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [/] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [/] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [/] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [/] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [/] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [/] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [/] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [/] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [/] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [/] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [/] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [/] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [/] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- The start/stop button increases in size when you hover over it
- A picture of a musical cat that I drew on my computer
- The buttons look like keys on a piano

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
- https://japaneseemoticons.me/cat-emoticons/5/ for the winning cat emoticon in the alert
- https://coolors.co/ for the color ideas
- https://www.w3schools.com/ for some guidance on sizing and alignment of elements
- https://fsymbols.com/heart/ for the symbols on the keys


2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

A major challenge that I experienced while working on this project was coming up with a good color scheme. Most of the colors that I liked did not look good together on the elements of the site. I ended up settling with a brown color for the container of the keys, to make it look like an actual piano and a light pink to accent it as the background, while the text and keys are either black or white. I also spent a long time trying to achieve the desired look of the buttons by using the border properties. I used a lot of outside research to help me figure out what parts of the border I could manipulate and in what ways I could do so. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

How long does it take to develop one website?
How many people usually work on the site?
How many jobs require full-stack development work?
What kind of other languages (besides HTML/CSS and Javascript) are used to develop sites and how are they used?
How do you develop a site with multiple pages?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I really want it to look more cohesive in design, so I would likely spend a good bit of time trying to learn more about the languages used to produce that result. Additionally, I really wanted the keys to sound like actual piano notes. I downloaded some free files for the notes I wanted, I just could not figure out how to get them to play when the buttons are pressed. Also, I wanted to add a feature that allows the user to choose the desired difficulty of play between easy, medium, or hard. Easy mode would function just as the program does currently, medium mode would play the clues at a faster pace and increase the sequence of notes to 12 from 8, and hard mode would play the clues even faster than medium, increase the sequence of notes to 16 from 12, and have a time limit on making guesses. I would also like to have included a visual strike counter and potentially a toggle for the strikes so that the user could choose to play with them or not.
